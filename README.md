# E-Commerce Shop Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The dashboard is built using Python and popular data visualization libraries such as **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Dash**. It provides insights into order trends, customer behavior, product performance, and other key metrics derived from the provided CSV files (`orders.csv` and `details.csv`).

The dashboard is hosted on GitHub and can be easily deployed or cloned for further customization.
